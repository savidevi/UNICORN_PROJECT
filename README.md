# UNICORN_PROJECT
#### Introduction:
This project will combine on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. The project includes 2 main parts with subtasks inside:

Data Exploration and Analysis using SQL, Spreadsheets and Tableau
Presentation of findings and insights.
I work individually on the first project part and in a small team of  4 on the second part of the project.

#### Project: 
The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.
My task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.

#### Project Logistics:
The first part of the project is my individual work. It is divided into 4 steps:

Explore Unicorn data sample organized in a form of a DB with 4 tables. Answer predefined questions with SQL.
Explore unified dataset (csv file) in Spreadsheets. Use tableau to visualize the data and find interesting insights. Create a dashboard that will answer the questions provided.
Use Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis and find a unique insight from the data set. Create a dashboard that will present the finding in a dynamic way.
Create a PPT on findings and insight with the team.
